## 1. Introduction
Purpose of the Module
The kfactor.py module is designed to manage and retrieve k-factors for elements and their X-ray lines. K-factors are essential for quantitative analysis in Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), as they allow the conversion of X-ray intensities into elemental concentrations. This module is specifically tailored for Bruker EDS detectors used in Hitachi HD2700 STEM systems.

Key Features
Predefined k-factors: Includes k-factors for a wide range of elements and their X-ray lines (K, L, M).

Flexible input formats: Supports lists of X-ray lines and EDS spectrum objects.

Easy retrieval: Quickly retrieve k-factors for specific elements and X-ray lines.
